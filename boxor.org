* BOXOR
  Let the gaims begin (is jus gaim)
** desc
   goal: KO opponent
   each person gets two boxing hands
   1v1 in the ring (no ropes, only void)
** ctrls
   wasd to move
   q/e to rotate
   j/k for left/right punch
** notes
   movement of character shouldn't be based on physics
   optimal if fists don't affect main box
   perhaps create invisible static bodies that remain fixed relative to main box
   fist bodies can attach to these so joint effect still present
** todo
*** DONE figure out box2d header file inclusion
*** DONE make complete structure of code w/o implementation, then compile/link
- find out why it can't compile (error: undefined symbs, "typeinfo for Player", referenced from typeinfo for P1 in p1.cpp.o)
  - [X] fixed, had to add =0 to make function pure virtual, to indicate player is a interface
*** implement most basic form (square w wasd capabilities on grid) 
- [X] o shit, drop test works
- does the alpha scaling work?, yup, make sure variables are floats to not round to 0
- [X] make box (four corners) drop test
- [X] implement rendering four corners with variable angle
  - draw diagram
- [X] make ground (edge shape, static)
  - got the edge set up (pointed by ground), just needs to render properly
  - it kind of worked, collision doesn't line up.
- [X] made box outline (render lines)
- [ ] speed cap, for better control (acc/decc fast), using variant maxForce in friction joint
- [X] create a world class
- [X] create friction joint in world class
- 
*** add in fists, figure out joint mechanics
- thinking prismatic or prismatic + distance combo
- [ ] duplicate v1.0 to make v1.1 
- 
*** TODO maybe learn git before doing manual version control
