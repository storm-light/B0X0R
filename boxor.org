* BOXOR
  Let the gaims begin (is jus gaim)
** desc
   goal: KO opponent
   each person gets two boxing hands
   1v1 in the ring (no ropes, only void)
** ctrls
wasd to move
   q/e to rotate
   j/k for left/right punch
** notes
   movement of character shouldn't be based on physics
   optimal if fists don't affect main box
   perhaps create invisible static bodies that remain fixed relative to main box
   fist bodies can attach to these so joint effect still present
** todo
*** DONE figure out box2d header file inclusion
*** DONE make complete structure of code w/o implementation, then compile/link
- find out why it can't compile (error: undefined symbs, "typeinfo for Player", referenced from typeinfo for P1 in p1.cpp.o)
  - [X] fixed, had to add =0 to make function pure virtual, to indicate player is a interface
*** DONE implement most basic form (square w wasd capabilities on grid) 
- [X] o shit, drop test works
- does the alpha scaling work?, yup, make sure variables are floats to not round to 0
- [X] make box (four corners) drop test
- [X] implement rendering four corners with variable angle
  - draw diagram
- [X] make ground (edge shape, static)
  - got the edge set up (pointed by ground), just needs to render properly
  - it kind of worked, collision doesn't line up.
- [X] made box outline (render lines)
- [ ] speed cap, for better control (acc/decc fast), using variant maxForce in friction joint
- [X] create a world class
- [X] create friction joint in world class
- 
*** DONE add in fists, figure out joint mechanics
- thinking prismatic or prismatic + distance combo
  - [X] create fist1/2 bodies, create prismaticJoints, then render 
  - used prismatic joint translation limits!
  - could potentially create another version to see if revolute joints can work as well
- [X] add fist impulse input (punching)
- could do several things to make mechanics better
  - remove main body from collision with just fist collision (and only fist input)
  - change mass of fist upon impact (have to use some sort of collision event listener if possible)
  - or instead of knocking them out of the area, could do hp and dmg only done by fists
    
*** DONE add arena and void
- for now, getting knocked out means body->center is outside
*** DONE add p2 
*** TODO improving mechanics
- [X] possible solution 1
  - create static body that mimics pos, ang of body
  - have joints w fists link with this teleporting static body (no fixtures)
    - teleporting/setTransform is reported to have a lot of bugs, try to use setLinearVelocity instead
    - WAIT NO WAY, may have found the solution: use kinematic body and setTransform + setLinVel + setAngVel, please no bugs
  - this can allow for greater fist density without affecting body rotation
- [X] let punch affect rotation to variable extent (no longer dependent only on prismatic joint)
  - dayum, the kinematic solution just made this game look so much better, rotation works also
- [ ] find a way to let rotation not totally affect punching power
  - has a bug where sometimes it doesn't appear to punch (some motor force is still being applied)
    - rotation has effect on power of punch, stopping rotation shows punches are normal
  - *maybe have a constant force on the other fist that prevents it from sliding forwards and backwards on rotation*
    - dude its actually starting to flow really nicely!!! by using forces instead of impulses
  - the rotation impulse seems a bit rigid; try to make more smooth if possible
    - this might also solve the weak punch problem
    - instead of impulse, apply force for timed amount (this can also prevent spammable punches)
      - [ ] timed amount (like a stamina bar)
*** TODO fix ccls
- got the symbolic link going... and it appears to be exactly the same as boxor_back...
- make the smallest working example possible to understand what's going on
** nice features
*** DONE figure out a way to make p1, p2 code more efficient, less duplicate code 
- [X] get rid of p1,p2 class entirely, just create p1_init method in player, remove includes of "p1.hpp", etc
*** DONE decide whether or not to dissolve world class 
*** make fists not collide with body
*** separate version w dmg instead of void:
- hmm, I'm leaning toward having an hp bar and that the boundaries are electric fences...
- damage based on magnitude of normal force in collision to main body
*** eventually change to rendering textures to make borders realistic
*** and eventually add death animation (perhaps shrinking textures to represent falling)
** tips and trix
*** if when running executable, input goes to terminal, resetting computer works! at least this time
** current version details
*** v1.1 
- uses anchor (kinematic body), instead of direct prismatic joint between fist and body
  - allows for high impact punches (fist density increased without affecting rotation)
- applies high magnitude force/torque into fists and body instead of impulse
- other fist is subjected to negating force
