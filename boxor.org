* BOXOR
  Let the gaims begin (is jus gaim)
** desc
   goal: KO opponent
   each person gets two boxing hands
   1v1 in the ring (no ropes, only void)
** ctrls
wasd to move
   q/e to rotate
   j/k for left/right punch
** notes
   movement of character shouldn't be based on physics
   optimal if fists don't affect main box
   perhaps create invisible static bodies that remain fixed relative to main box
   fist bodies can attach to these so joint effect still present
** todo
*** DONE figure out box2d header file inclusion
*** DONE make complete structure of code w/o implementation, then compile/link
- find out why it can't compile (error: undefined symbs, "typeinfo for Player", referenced from typeinfo for P1 in p1.cpp.o)
  - [X] fixed, had to add =0 to make function pure virtual, to indicate player is a interface
*** DONE implement most basic form (square w wasd capabilities on grid) 
- [X] o shit, drop test works
- does the alpha scaling work?, yup, make sure variables are floats to not round to 0
- [X] make box (four corners) drop test
- [X] implement rendering four corners with variable angle
  - draw diagram
- [X] make ground (edge shape, static)
  - got the edge set up (pointed by ground), just needs to render properly
  - it kind of worked, collision doesn't line up.
- [X] made box outline (render lines)
- [ ] speed cap, for better control (acc/decc fast), using variant maxForce in friction joint
- [X] create a world class
- [X] create friction joint in world class
- 
*** DONE add in fists, figure out joint mechanics
- thinking prismatic or prismatic + distance combo
  - [X] create fist1/2 bodies, create prismaticJoints, then render 
  - used prismatic joint translation limits!
  - could potentially create another version to see if revolute joints can work as well
- [X] add fist impulse input (punching)
- could do several things to make mechanics better
  - remove main body from collision with just fist collision (and only fist input)
  - change mass of fist upon impact (have to use some sort of collision event listener if possible)
  - or instead of knocking them out of the area, could do hp and dmg only done by fists
    
*** DONE add arena and void
- for now, getting knocked out means body->center is outside
*** DONE add p2 
*** DONE improving mechanics
- [X] possible solution 1
  - create static body that mimics pos, ang of body
  - have joints w fists link with this teleporting static body (no fixtures)
    - teleporting/setTransform is reported to have a lot of bugs, try to use setLinearVelocity instead
    - WAIT NO WAY, may have found the solution: use kinematic body and setTransform + setLinVel + setAngVel, please no bugs
  - this can allow for greater fist density without affecting body rotation
- [X] let punch affect rotation to variable extent (no longer dependent only on prismatic joint)
  - dayum, the kinematic solution just made this game look so much better, rotation works also
- [X] find a way to let rotation not totally affect punching power
  - *maybe have a constant force on the other fist that prevents it from sliding forwards and backwards on rotation*
    - dude its actually starting to flow really nicely!!! by using forces instead of impulses
    - instead of impulse, apply force for timed amount (this can also prevent spammable punches)
      - [X] timed amount (like a stamina bar)
*** DONE make fists not collide with fists; collision filtering
- might be necessary since forces on fist don't impact movement of body
- this doesn't fix bug where body can't push other body through forces impacting fists
  - however, this may not be fixable bc if we were to disable fist-body collision and re-enable within fist is in body, it would super spazz?
  - read "anatomy of a collision" to find out
  - but even if implementable, might be a good idea to come back to it in v2.0 or later
    - mechanics are satisfying for now
    - mechanics may need updates when actual multiplayer is tested
- could allow collision on special moves like "block"
*** DONE texturing players
- can't get fists to render, though body renders fine
  - fixed, it was because BoxToSDL casted input to int while input was a <1 float
*** TODO implement arcade feel
- [X] titlescreen
- [ ] scoring system
- [X] 640x480 border/arena
- implement Loop::reset()
*** TODO fix auto-completion
- got the symbolic link going... and it appears to be exactly the same as boxor_back...
- *make the smallest working example possible to understand what's going on*
  - this could be resolved by creating that emacs core config file
- missing .ccls-cache or .ccls?
- it might be the fault of company-mode since that's the auto-completion package
  - read into what each packages does
** nice features
*** DONE figure out a way to make p1, p2 code more efficient, less duplicate code 
- [X] get rid of p1,p2 class entirely, just create p1_init method in player, remove includes of "p1.hpp", etc
*** DONE decide whether or not to dissolve world class 
*** separate version w dmg instead of void:
- hmm, I'm leaning toward having an hp bar and that the boundaries are electric fences...
- damage based on collision data
*** enable anti-aliasing or such to make textures look smooth (on rotation)
*** limit max velocity by adjusting friction proportionally (this seems tough)
- or maybe not, just translate "moving at a constant speed" to a higher dimension
*** fix bug where can't move another player by pushing their fist
*** add special moves such block
- where fists a different set of fists, with revolute joints, rotate to front of body and fist-fist collision enabled
- prismatic joint fists are temporarily disabled and not rendered
- successful block gives bonus stamina or similar
** tips and trix
*** if when running executable, input goes to terminal, resetting computer works! at least this time
*** git checkout [commit hash]
** current version details
*** v1.1
- uses anchor (kinematic body), instead of direct prismatic joint between fist and body
  - allows for high impact punches (fist density increased without affecting rotation)
- applies high magnitude force/torque into fists and body instead of impulse
- other fist is subjected to negating force
*** v1.1.1
- [X] remove fist on fist collision
*** v1.1.2
- texturing of players
*** v1.1.3
- what's next?
- possible directions:
  - somehow perfect mechanics 
  - or other tools to make online multiplayer boxor, or direct connect dolphin sort of thing (netcode???)
    - could do this, then later after people test, perfect mechanics (allows for much easier testing/feedback)
      - *I like this idea the best so far*
    - could send to gage and andrew lee for them to test and receive feedback first
  - make macOS application for easy distribution? or just set up build instructions on github
  - remember that old ideas can be borrowed and improved upon (cough cough Riot Games w/ Valorant)
  - take slow time to think about it, can work on coding challenges + emacs core config in the meantime
- so current plan of attack
  1. first, gotta cut down on some shit, can't have too many possibilities, pick the best
  2. make game fully arcade mode and presentable for testing (score system, titlescreen)
     - change to standard 640x480 and area becomes the window borders 
  3. allow others to test (need to include SDL2 frameworks on github for building), receive feedback
  4. based on this, and coding branch tests (like trying revolute instead of prismatic joint), perfect mechanics as best as possible
  5. work towards making online version
     - this would be a huge step, maybe have to port to different engine/language
